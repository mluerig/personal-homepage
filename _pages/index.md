Hi there! :wave:

<br>
<br>

Iâ€™m an evolutionary ecologist studying phenotypic variation within and across species to understand the mechanisms of biological diversification. I am currently working in the <a id="link" href="https://www.biovisionlab.com/"> Biovision lab </a> at the Florida Museum of Natural history (University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA). This website is mostly about my research, but I also use it compile and communicate techy stuff that I find interesting or useful. Feel free to look around and <a id="link" href="mailto:{{ site.author.email | encode_email }}"> drop me a line </a> if you'd like to have a chat.
