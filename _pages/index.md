Hi! :wave:

I am an evolutionary ecologist working on understanding both ultimate and proximate causes of phenotypic variation within and across natural populations. This website is mostly about my science, but I also use it collect techy stuff that I find interesting or useful. Feel free to look around or <a id="link" href="mailto:{{ site.author.email | encode_email }}"> drop me a line </a> if you'd like to have a chat.
